# piacere-domlr README

This is an extension for VS Code to provide syntax highlighting for a DSL (Domain Specific Language) I made to write requirements for a [DOML (DevOps Modelling Language)](https://www.piacere-doml.deib.polimi.it) model checker.

## Features

Right now it supports only Syntax Highlighting.

I'm looking into adding a small language server to provide contextual suggestions (especially when writing relationship names; e.g.: `abstract.ComputingNode.ifaces`).
